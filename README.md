# Don Michael Feeney Jr.

**Life-science software engineer focused on regulated, safety-critical systems.**

I build transparent, reproducible software for biological, diagnostic, and quality-driven environments, with direct experience in GMP manufacturing, validation, and regulated data systems.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- biological systems
- software engineering
- quality & regulatory compliance
- interpretable AI and diagnostics

## What’s in this GitHub

This profile hosts:
- research code supporting published and preprint work
- validation and diagnostic tooling for biological systems
- governance and safety layers for AI-assisted systems
- exploratory system models with explicit falsification criteria

The emphasis throughout is on **clarity, auditability, and trust**.

## Professional Focus

- GMP / GLP-aligned software systems  
- Digital validation (IQ / OQ / PQ)  
- Quality systems, MES & LIMS  
- Deterministic and interpretable analytics  
- Research-driven diagnostics and stability analysis  

I prioritize systems that remain explainable under scrutiny and safe to deploy in real biological and human contexts.

## Engineering Principles

I build systems that are:
- interpretable over opaque  
- reproducible over optimized  
- auditable over clever  
- falsifiable rather than impressionistic  

---

## Professional Context

This work is informed by:
- hands-on GMP manufacturing and quality experience  
- regulated software validation and documentation practices  
- independent research with an emphasis on testability and rigor
