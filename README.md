# 👋 Hi, I'm Don

### Life-Science Software Engineer | Quality Systems | Regulated Environments

I build transparent, reproducible software for biological, diagnostic, and quality-driven environments, with direct experience in GMP manufacturing, validation, and regulated data systems.

**My work sits at the intersection of:**
- 🧬 Biological systems
- 💻 Software engineering
- ✅ Quality & regulatory compliance
- 🤖 Interpretable AI and diagnostics

---

## 🔬 What I'm Currently Working On

- Preparing for M.S. in Pharmaceutical Science at Thomas Jefferson University (Fall 2026)
- Building safety and governance layers for AI-enabled systems
- Developing diagnostic and validation tooling for biological systems
- Research in computational diagnostics and biosignal modeling

---

## 📂 What's in this GitHub

This profile hosts:
- 📊 Research code supporting published and preprint work
- 🔍 Validation and diagnostic tooling for biological systems
- 🛡️ Governance and safety layers for AI-assisted systems
- 🧪 Exploratory system models with explicit falsification criteria

**The emphasis throughout is on clarity, auditability, and trust.**

## 💼 Professional Focus

- 🏭 GMP / GLP-aligned software systems  
- ✓ Digital validation (IQ / OQ / PQ)  
- 📋 Quality systems, MES & LIMS  
- 📈 Deterministic and interpretable analytics  
- 🔬 Research-driven diagnostics and stability analysis  

**Philosophy:** I prioritize systems that remain explainable under scrutiny and safe to deploy in real biological and human contexts.

## ⚙️ Engineering Principles

I build systems that are:
- 🔍 **Interpretable** over opaque  
- 🔄 **Reproducible** over optimized  
- 📝 **Auditable** over clever  
- 🧪 **Falsifiable** rather than impressionistic
