# Don Michael Feeney Jr.

**Life-science software engineer focused on regulated, safety-critical systems.**

I build transparent, reproducible software for biological, diagnostic, and quality-driven environments, with direct experience in GMP manufacturing, validation, and regulated data systems.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- biological systems
- software engineering
- quality & regulatory compliance
- interpretable AI and diagnostics

---

## Professional Focus

- GMP / GLP-aligned software systems  
- Digital validation (IQ / OQ / PQ)  
- Quality systems, MES & LIMS  
- Deterministic and interpretable analytics  
- Research-driven diagnostics and stability analysis  

I prioritize **clarity, auditability, and trust** over black-box performance.
